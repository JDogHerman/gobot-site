Last week we took the robot world tour to Brussels, Belgium for [FOSDEM 2017](https://fosdem.org/2017/). Founded in 2000, FOSDEM is unarguably one of Europe's most fun and important open source conferences, and we were excited to share our work in open source robotics & IoT using Golang.

Lots of enthusiasm energized the conference, and the Golang room was so packed that they literally stopped people from coming in. Crazy! The live video feed was excellent, however, and the entire talk was recorded on video. [You can watch it online here](http://ftp.fau.de/fosdem/2017/H.1302/go_gobot.vp8.webm).

Thanks to all of you who came out to see us, we had a great time sharing our latest work in preparation for the release of Golang 1.8 next week!
