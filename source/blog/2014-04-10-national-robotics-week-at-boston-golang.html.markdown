Continuing our robot road show in recognition of [National Robotics Week](http://nationalroboticsweek.org), we brought Gobot ([http://gobot.io](http://gobot.io)) our [Golang](http://golang.org/) robotics framework, to Boston to speak to [BostonGolang](http://bostongolang.org/). Boston has a thriving technology community, and we were happy to present our work to one of the most quickly growing meetup groups focusing on the Go programming language.

Held at the [Akamai](http://www.akamai.com/) offices in Cambridge, we had just introduced our new ["10 Rules Of Robot Ops"](http://robotops.com) site earlier in the day, so we used that as the theme for the talk. We had also just finished support for the [Neurosky Mindwave Mobile EEG](http://store.neurosky.com/products/mindwave-mobile), and it was neat to incorporate Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). We also demoed our Golang powered version of Conway's Game of Life using [Sphero](http://www.gosphero.com) robots.

Thanks to all of you who came out to see us, we had a great time sharing our latest work with Boston's Golang community of enthsuiasts! 

Please follow us on Twitter at [@gobotio](http://twitter.com/gobotio) for the latest news and information, as we continue to work on this exciting platform.
