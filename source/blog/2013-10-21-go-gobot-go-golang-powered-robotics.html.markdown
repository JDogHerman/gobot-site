We are very excited to introduce Gobot (<a href="http://gobot.io" target="blank">http://gobot.io</a>), a new and powerful open source robotics platform written using the Go programming language. Go has remarkable abilities when it comes to massive concurrency with only modest use of system resources. In addition, the expressive nature of the programming language makes it really nice code to work with.

Our team will post here with all our exciting developments, as well as anything else of interest to the robot community. We've got a lot of plans in store for all of you, our dear users, so please follow us on Twitter at [@gobotio](http://twitter.com/gobotio) to follow our progress.
