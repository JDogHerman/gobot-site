The Gobot team was in attendance at the recent [Intel Developer Forum]() in San Francisco, and we were able to get one of the new [Intel Edison]() single board computers. We had previously tried out the [Intel Galileo](), but were unable to run Golang code, due to the [Galileo not having the MMX instruction set]().

Once we got the Edison, we immediately retired to a corner there at the conference to put the Edison thru its paces. The answer was success! The Edison is able to run compiled Go code.

Here is how we got it "go"-ing, if you will. Basic workflow for cross-compilation here...

Of course, we wanted to use the Edison to access the GPIO & i2c pins to communicate with other devices. So we got to work, in many cases reading code helpfully provided by the Intel IoT team's [MRAA library](). In others, simply blazing a trail of code.

With that, we present to you, [gobot-edison](), our support in Gobot for the Edison board's wonderful capabilities.

Here is the code we used to run the above sample, using Gobot to control the Edison's GPIO for reading analog input, and then PWM output.

We also have implemented i2c support. In the above video, we are showing an Edison running Gobot communicating with a BlinkM. Here is the code:

We are very excited about the possibilities of this new board from Intel, now that we can run Golang and Gobot on it!
