Gobot was mentioned in the recent interview with The Hybrid Group Ringleader [Ron Evans](https://twitter.com/deadprogram) in the venerable [SD Times](http://sdtimes.com/) about the Internet of Things (IoT) and future implications of a connected world.

Evans describes his real-world experiences, open source IoT, security & privacy, and why he thinks the Intel Edison is so interesting. Read the full post titled "Internet of Things: Closing the gap between customers, business" [here](http://sdtimes.com/closing-the-gap-between-customers-business/).
