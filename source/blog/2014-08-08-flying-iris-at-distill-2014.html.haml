Held at the [Palace of Fine Arts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Fine_Arts), we were very lucky to fly a [3DRobotics Iris](http://3drobotics.com/iris/) around using a pre-release of our new support of the [Mavlink protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAVLink) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).
