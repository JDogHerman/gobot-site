    The Grove - Button is a momentary push button. It contains one independent "momentary on/off" button.
    “Momentary” means that the button rebounds on its own after it is released. The button outputs a HIGH
    signal when pressed, and LOW when released. The button signals the SIG Pin of the Grove Interface while
    NC is not used at all.
