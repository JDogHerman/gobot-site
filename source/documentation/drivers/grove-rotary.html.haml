    The rotary angle sensor produces analog output between 0 and Vcc (5V DC with Seeeduino) on its D1 connector.
    The D2 connector is not used. The angular range is 300 degrees with a linear change in value. The resistance
    value is 10k ohms, perfect for Arduino use. This may also be known as a “potentiometer ”.
