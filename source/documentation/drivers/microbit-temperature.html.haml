%h2 How To Connect
:markdown
   The Microbit is a Bluetooth LE device, so you use the Gobot `ble.ClientAdaptor` to connect. You need to know the BLE address or name of the device.

:markdown
         bleAdaptor := ble.NewClientAdaptor("c5:b9:46:fd:40:c0")
         ubit := microbit.NewTemperatureDriver(bleAdaptor)

%h2 How To Use

Once you have connected using the ble.ClientAdaptor, you can call any of the Driver's methods, or subscribe to any of the driver's events.

:markdown
         ubit.On(microbit.Temperature, func(data interface{}) {
            fmt.Println("Temperature", data)
         })
