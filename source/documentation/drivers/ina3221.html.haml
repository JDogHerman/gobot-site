:markdown
  Install the package with: `go get gobot.io/x/gobot`

  You must pass in an Adaptor that supports the `i2c.Connector` interface to use with this Driver.

  You can use the following optional params if you wish to change the I2C Bus and I2C Address from the default values.

    `i2c.WithBus(int)`:	bus to use with this driver.

    `i2c.WithAddress(int)`:	address to use with this driver

:markdown
      :::go
      // default bus/address
      bpm180 := i2c.NewINA3221Driver(adaptor)

      // optional bus/address
      bpm180 := i2c.NewINA3221Driver(adaptor,
                                     i2c.WithBus(0),
                                     i2c.WithAddress(0x34))
