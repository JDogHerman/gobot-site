    # Metal Gobot

    Use Metal Gobot when you want to use the individual Gobot packages yourself to have the greatest control, or to more easily integrate Gobot functionality into your existing Golang programs.

    Let's revisit the "Blink" code example from the "Getting Started" page, written using "Metal Gobot" style:

    ### Metal Blink

        :::go
        package main

        import (
        	"gobot.io/x/gobot/drivers/gpio"
        	"gobot.io/x/gobot/platforms/intel-iot/edison"
        	"time"
        )

        func main() {
        	e := edison.NewAdaptor()
        	e.Connect()

        	led := gpio.NewLedDriver(e, "13")
        	led.Start()

        	for {
        		led.Toggle()
        		time.Sleep(1000 * time.Millisecond)
        	}
        }

    This is a nice simple example. You `Connect()` the Adaptor, you `Start()` the Driver, and away you go.

    Here is a slightly more sophsticated example that uses Metal Gobot along with an Event channel:

    ### Metal Button

        :::go
        package main

        import (
        	"fmt"

        	"gobot.io/x/gobot/drivers/gpio"
        	"gobot.io/x/gobot/platforms/intel-iot/edison"
        )

        func main() {
        	e := edison.NewAdaptor()
        	e.Connect()

        	led := gpio.NewLedDriver(e, "13")
        	led.Start()
        	led.Off()

        	button := gpio.NewButtonDriver(e, "5")
        	button.Start()

        	buttonEvents := button.Subscribe()
        	for {
        		select {
        		case event := <-buttonEvents:
        			fmt.Println("Event:", event.Name, event.Data)
        			if event.Name == gpio.ButtonPush {
        				led.Toggle()
        			}
        		}
        	}
        }

    ## How to use it

    When using Metal Gobot you need to make calls directly to Adaptors and/or Drivers yourself.

    You will need to call `Connect()` on each Adaptor yourself. Likewise, you will need to call `Start()` on each Driver.

    Once this is done, you can then use the Adaptors and Drivers directly however you wish.
