    %p
      This repository contains the Gobot adaptor for Pebble smart watch 
      = link_to "(http://getpebble.com/).", "http://getpebble.com/", target: :blank

    %p 
      It uses the Pebble 2.0 SDK, and requires the 2.0 iOS or Android app, and that the "watchbot" app 
      = link_to "(https://github.com/hybridgroup/watchbot) ", "ttps://github.com/hybridgroup/watchbot", target: :blank
      has been installed on the Pebble watch

  %h2 How to install
  %p 
    Information on how to set up your Pebble with gobot can be found 
    = link_to "here.", "http://godoc.org/github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/pebble", target: :blank

  %h2 How to connect
  %p This software requires version 1.12.0 of the Pebble watch firmware.

  %h3 OSX

  %p The main steps are:

  %ul
    %li Pair your computer and the Pebble
    %li Use a socket to serial connection to map a TCP socket to the local port
    %li Connect to the device via gobot
    %li To figure out which port your pebble is connected to, use the gobot connect scan command:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ gobot connect scan

  %p Now you are ready to connect to the Sphero using the socket, in this example port 4567:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        gobot connect serial 4567 pebble

  %h3 Ubuntu

  %p The main steps are:

  %ul
    %li Pair your computer and the Pebble
    %li Map your device to a port
    %li Use a socket to serial connection to map a TCP socket to the local port
    %li Connect to the device via gobot
    %li You will need to pair with the Pebble, entering any needed password.

  %p Then you can find the Bluetooth address, for example 00:18:33:86:37:8B, by using the gobot connect scan command:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ gobot connect scan

  %p Once you know the address, you can use the gobot connect bind command to map a port to the device:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        gobot connect bind 00:18:33:86:37:8B pebble

  %p Now you are ready to connect to the Pebble using a socket, in this example port 4567:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        gobot connect socat pebble 4567
