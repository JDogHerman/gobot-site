  %p
    Thanks to
    %strong Gobot
    and
    %strong Go
    it is possible to interact with several I/O hardware devices and interfaces connected to the Arduino
    using a set of already defined and easy to use drivers, all of this thanks to the Gobot architecture, in conjunction with the Gobot Firmata
    adaptor by using the Firmata communication protocol).
    This makes it possible to swap the entire platform for a different hardware platform, and keep using the same code you just wrote for
    Arduino, this just by swapping a couple of lines in your program.
  %p
    Available drivers for the Arduino platform are listed below, the drivers contain detailed documentation and examples of what kind
    physical computing (using Gobot and Go) you could be doing:
