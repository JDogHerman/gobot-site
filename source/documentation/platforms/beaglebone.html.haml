  %h2 How To Install
  %p
    Installing Gobot for beaglebone is pretty easy.
  :markdown
        :::bash
        go get github.com/hybridgroup/gobot && go install github.com/hybridgroup/platforms/beaglebone

  %h2 Cross compiling for the Beaglebone Black
  %p You must first configure your Go environment for arm linux cross compiling
  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ cd $GOROOT/src
        $ GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm ./make.bash --no-clean
  %p Then compile your Gobot program with
  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ GOARM=7 GOARCH=arm GOOS=linux go build examples/beaglebone_blink.go
  %p If you are running the official Angstrom or Debian linux through the usb->ethernet connection, you can simply upload your program and execute it with
  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ scp beaglebone_blink root@192.168.7.2:/home/root/
        $ ssh -t root@192.168.7.2 "./beaglebone_blink"

%section.how-to#HowToUse
  %h2 How To Use
  %p
    This small program causes an LED to blink.
  :markdown
        :::go
        package main

        import (
            "time"

            "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot"

            "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/gpio"
        )

        func main() {
            gbot := gobot.NewGobot()

            beagleboneAdaptor := beaglebone.NewBeagleboneAdaptor("beaglebone")
            led := gpio.NewLedDriver(beagleboneAdaptor, "led", "P9_12")

            work := func() {
                gobot.Every(1*time.Second, func() {
                    led.Toggle()
                })
            }

            robot := gobot.NewRobot("blinkBot",
                []gobot.Connection{beagleboneAdaptor},
                []gobot.Device{led},
                work,
            )

            gbot.AddRobot(robot)

            gbot.Start()
        }
