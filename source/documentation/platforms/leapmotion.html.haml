  %p The main steps are:

  %ul
    %li Run Leap Motion.app to open a websocket connection in port 6437.
    %li Connect your Computer and Leap Motion Controller.
    %li Connect to the device via Gobot.

  %h3 Ubuntu
  %p
    The Linux download of the Leap Motion software can be obtained from
    %a{ href:"https://developer.leapmotion.com/downloads" } Leap Motion Dev Center
    (requires free signup)
  %p The main steps are:
  %ul
    %li Run the leapd daemon, to open a websocket connection in port 6437.
    %li Connect your computer and the Leap Motion controller
    %li Connect to the device via Gobot
