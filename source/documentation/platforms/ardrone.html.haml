  %h2 How To Install
  %p Installing Gobot with ardrone support is pretty easy.
  :markdown
        :::bash
        go get github.com/hybridgroup/gobot && go install github.com/hybridgroup/platforms/ardrone

  %h2 How To Use
  %p This small program lets the ARDrone take-off, hover, and land.

  :markdown
        :::go
        package main

        import (
            "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot"
            "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/ardrone"
            "time"
        )

        func main() {
            gbot := gobot.NewGobot()
            adaptor := ardrone.NewArdroneAdaptor("Drone")
            drone := ardrone.NewArdroneDriver(adaptor, "Drone")

            work := func() {
                drone.TakeOff()
                gobot.On(drone.Events["Flying"], func(data interface{}) {
                    gobot.After(3*time.Second, func() {
                        drone.Land()
                    })
                })
            }

            gbot.Robots = append(gbot.Robots,
                gobot.NewRobot("drone", []gobot.Connection{adaptor}, []gobot.Device{drone}, work))

            gbot.Start()
        }

%section.how-to#HowToConnect
  %h2 How To Connect
  %p The ARDrone is a WiFi device, so there is no additional work to establish a connection to a single drone. However, in order to connect to multiple drones, you need to perform some configuration steps on each drone via SSH.
