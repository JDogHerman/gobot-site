    %p
      Sphero is a sophisticated and programmable robot housed in a polycarbonate sphere shell.

      The gobot-sphero adaptor makes it easy to interact with Sphero using Go, once you have your Sphero setup and connected to your computer
      you can start writing code to make Sphero move, change direction, speed and colors, or detect Sphero events and execute some
      code when they occur.
