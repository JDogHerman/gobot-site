    Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.

    This package provides the adaptor for microcontrollers such as Arduino that support the [Firmata](http://firmata.org/wiki/Main_Page) protocol

    ## How to Install

        go get github.com/hybridgroup/gobot && go install github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/firmata


    ## How to Use

        :::go
        package main
        
        import (
        	"time"
        
        	"github.com/hybridgroup/gobot"
        	"github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/firmata"
        	"github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/gpio"
        )
        
        func main() {
        	gbot := gobot.NewGobot()
        
        	firmataAdaptor := firmata.NewFirmataAdaptor("arduino", "/dev/ttyACM0")
        	led := gpio.NewLedDriver(firmataAdaptor, "led", "13")
        
        	work := func() {
        		gobot.Every(1*time.Second, func() {
        			led.Toggle()
        		})
        	}
        
        	robot := gobot.NewRobot("bot",
        		[]gobot.Connection{firmataAdaptor},
        		[]gobot.Device{led},
        		work,
        	)
        
        	gbot.AddRobot(robot)
        
        	gbot.Start()
        }

    ## Hardware Support
    The following firmata devices have been tested and are currently supported:

      - [Arduino uno r3](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno)
      - [Teensy 3.0](http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy3.html)

    More devices are coming soon...
