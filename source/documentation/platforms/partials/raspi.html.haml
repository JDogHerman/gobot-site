    The Raspberry Pi is an inexpensive and popular ARM based single board computer with digital & PWM GPIO, and i2c interfaces built in.

    The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card-sized single-board computer developed in the UK by the Raspberry Pi Foundation with the intention of promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools

    ## How to Install

    First you must install the appropriate Go packages

        go get -d -u github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/... && go install github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/raspi


    #### Cross compiling for the Raspberry Pi
    You must first configure your Go environment for linux cross compiling

        :::bash
        $ cd $GOROOT/src
        $ GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm ./make.bash --no-clean
        


    Then compile your Gobot program with

        :::bash
        $ GOARM=6 GOARCH=arm GOOS=linux examples/raspi_blink.go


    Then you can simply upload your program over the network from your host computer to the Raspi

        :::bash
        $ scp raspi_blink pi@192.168.1.xxx:/home/pi/


    and execute it on your Raspberry Pi with

        :::bash
        $ ./raspi_blink


    ## How to Use

        :::go
        package main
        
        import (
                "time"
        
                "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot"
                "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/gpio"
                "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/raspi"
        )
        
        func main() {
                gbot := gobot.NewGobot()
        
                r := raspi.NewRaspiAdaptor("raspi")
                led := gpio.NewLedDriver(r, "led", "7")
        
                work := func() {
                        gobot.Every(1*time.Second, func() {
                                led.Toggle()
                        })
                }
        
                robot := gobot.NewRobot("blinkBot",
                        []gobot.Connection{r},
                        []gobot.Device{led},
                        work,
                )
        
                gbot.AddRobot(robot)
        
                gbot.Start()
        }
