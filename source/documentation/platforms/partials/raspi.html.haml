    The Raspberry Pi is an inexpensive and popular ARM based single board computer with digital & PWM GPIO, and i2c interfaces built in.

    The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card-sized single-board computer developed in the UK by the Raspberry Pi Foundation with the intention of promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools

    ## How to Install

        go get -d -u gobot.io/x/gobot/... && go install gobot.io/x/gobot/platforms/raspi


    ## How to Use

    The pin numbering used by your Gobot program should match the way your board is labeled right on the board itself.

        :::go
        package main
        
        import (
                "time"
        
                "gobot.io/x/gobot"
                "gobot.io/x/gobot/drivers/gpio"
                "gobot.io/x/gobot/platforms/raspi"
        )
        
        func main() {
                r := raspi.NewAdaptor()
                led := gpio.NewLedDriver(r, "7")
        
                work := func() {
                        gobot.Every(1*time.Second, func() {
                                led.Toggle()
                        })
                }
        
                robot := gobot.NewRobot("blinkBot",
                        []gobot.Connection{r},
                        []gobot.Device{led},
                        work,
                )
        
                robot.Start()
        }


    ## How to Connect

    ### Compiling

    Simply compile your Gobot program like this:

        :::bash
        $ GOARM=6 GOARCH=arm GOOS=linux examples/raspi_blink.go


    Then you can simply upload your program over the network from your host computer to the Raspi

        :::bash
        $ scp raspi_blink pi@192.168.1.xxx:/home/pi/


    and execute it on your Raspberry Pi with

        :::bash
        $ ./raspi_blink


    ### Enabling PWM output on GPIO pins.

    For extended PWM support on the Raspberry Pi, you will need to use a program called pi-blaster. You can follow the instructions for pi-blaster install in the pi-blaster repo here:

    [https://github.com/sarfata/pi-blaster](https://github.com/sarfata/pi-blaster)

    ### Special note for Raspian Wheezy users

    The Golang version installed from the default package repositories is very old and will not compile Gobot. You can install go 1.4 as follows:

        :::bash
        $ wget -O - http://dave.cheney.net/paste/go1.4.linux-arm~multiarch-armv6-1.tar.gz|sudo tar -xzC /usr/local -f -
        
        $ echo '# Setup for golang' |sudo tee /etc/profile.d/golang.sh
        $ echo 'PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin'|sudo tee -a /etc/profile.d/golang.sh
        
        $ source /etc/profile.d/golang.sh
