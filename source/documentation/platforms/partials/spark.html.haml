    The Spark Core contains a Wi-Fi connected microcontroller. Once it connects to a Wi-Fi network, it automatically connects with a central server (the "Spark Cloud") and stays connected so it can be controlled from external systems, such as a Gobot program. To run gobot programs please make sure you are running default tinker firmware on the Spark Core.

    ## How to Install

    Installing Gobot with Spark support is pretty easy.

        go get github.com/hybridgroup/gobot && go install github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/spark


    ## How to Use

        :::go
        package main
        
        import (
        	"time"
        
        	"github.com/hybridgroup/gobot"
        	"github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/gpio"
        	"github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/spark"
        )
        
        func main() {
        	gbot := gobot.NewGobot()
        
        	sparkCore := spark.NewSparkCoreAdaptor("spark", "device_id", "access_token")
        	led := gpio.NewLedDriver(sparkCore, "led", "D7")
        
        	work := func() {
        		gobot.Every(1*time.Second, func() {
        			led.Toggle()
        		})
        	}
        
        	robot := gobot.NewRobot("spark",
        		[]gobot.Connection{sparkCore},
        		[]gobot.Device{led},
        		work,
        	)
        
        	gbot.AddRobot(robot)
        
        	gbot.Start()
        }
