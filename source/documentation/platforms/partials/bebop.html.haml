    ## How to Install

        go get -d -u github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/... && go install github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/bebop

    ## How to Use

        :::go
        package main

        import (
            "time"
            "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot"
            "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/bebop"
        )

        func main() {
            gbot := gobot.NewGobot()
            bebopAdaptor := bebop.NewBebopAdaptor("Drone")
            drone := bebop.NewBebopDriver(bebopAdaptor, "Drone")

            work := func() {
            drone.HullProtection(true)
                drone.TakeOff()
                gobot.On(drone.Event("flying"), func(data interface{}) {
                    gobot.After(3*time.Second, func() {
                        drone.Land()
                    })
                })
            }

            robot := gobot.NewRobot("drone",
                []gobot.Connection{bebopAdaptor},
                []gobot.Device{drone},
                work,
            )

            gbot.AddRobot(robot)
            gbot.Start()
        }

    ## How to Connect

    The Bebop is a WiFi device, so there is no additional work to establish a connection
    to a single drone. However, in order to connect to multiple drones, you need to perform
    some configuration steps on each drone via SSH.
