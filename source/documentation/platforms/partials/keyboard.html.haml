        ## How to Connect

        All that you need to do is plug the keyboard into your computer as usual.

        ## Examples

        This small program receives events from keyboard

            :::go
            package main

            import (
                "fmt"
                "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot"
                "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/keyboard"
            )

            func main() {
                gbot := gobot.NewGobot()
                keys := keyboard.NewKeyboardDriver("keyboard")

                work := func() {
                    gobot.On(keys.Event("key"), func(data interface{}) {
                        key := data.(keyboard.KeyEvent)

                        if key.Key == keyboard.A {
                            fmt.Println("A pressed!")
                        } else {
                            fmt.Println("keyboard event!", key, key.Char)
                        }
                    })
                }

                robot := gobot.NewRobot("keyboardbot",
                    []gobot.Connection{},
                    []gobot.Device{keys},
                    work,
                )

                gbot.AddRobot(robot)
                gbot.Start()
            }
