  .info-intro
    %p The Spark Core contains a Wi-Fi connected microcontroller. Once it connects to a Wi-Fi network, it automatically connects with a central server (the "Spark Cloud") and stays connected so it can be controlled from external systems, such as a Gobot program.
    %p
      %b
        To run gobot programs please make sure you are running default tinker firmware on the Spark Core.
